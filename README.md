# [`explore.open223.info`](https://explore.open223.info)

This repository generates interactive documentation of S223 using @ektrah's excellent https://github.com/ektrah/rdf-toolkit tool. The pages will rebuild on every push to `main`. If you want to add an ontology other than S223, add the .ttl file to the `ontologies` folder and update the GitHub workflow file appropriately
